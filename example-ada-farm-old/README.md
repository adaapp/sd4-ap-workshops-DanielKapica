# Ada Farm v2.0

Welcome to the farm.

This workshop develops on the Ada Farm workshop run during Cohort 4's Launchpad. It is intended to supercharge your OOP skills, enabling you to demonstrate an understanding of encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.

A further advanced version of this workshop will ask you to implement abstract classes, interfaces, and static methods using TypeScript.

## Tasks

* Update the code to use encapsulation throughout. Setters and getters and private methods using an approach of your choice.
* Create dedicated classes for specific crops (the given crops are pumpkins, carrots and wheat) that inherit from the Crop class
* Extend these classes to make instances of them polymorphic
* Implement tests for your Crop class

## Stretch tasks

* Create an animal class and child classes for animals of your choice. Extend these classes with appropriate methods.
* Create a game class that is responsible for the overall farm, replacing the arrays of fields in index.js. Use this class to track the overall health of the farm.
* Implement tests for everything
